# Django-E-commerce-Learning-Project
Welcome to my Django e-commerce learning project repository! This project is based on the tutorial series from the JustDjango YouTube channel, where I'm learning to build a fully functional e-commerce website using Django.

## Overview
--This Django project is my learning journey through the world of e-commerce development. Here's what I'm covering:

- Product management: Creating, updating, and displaying products with details such as name, description, price, and images.
- User authentication: Implementing user registration, login, logout, and profile management functionalities.
- Shopping cart: Allowing users to add and remove items from their shopping cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- Order management: Handling the process of placing orders, generating order summaries, and processing payments.
- Frontend interface: Designing and implementing an intuitive user interface using HTML templates, CSS styling, and JavaScript/jQuery for interactivity.
